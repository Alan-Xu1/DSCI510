1.	What are the strengths of your data modeling format?
I use the state abbreviations as the keys that connect all three of my tables in the SQL data base. SQL database makes adding additional
information quite easy and generally most information pertaining to my project will include state names. SQL database also supports easy
reordering, union or disjoint operations should I need it.

2.	What are the weaknesses?  (Does your data model support?  Sorting the information? Re-ordering it?  Only obtaining a certain subset of the information?)
I think the biggest weakness in the SQL database is that primary keys need to be unique which is problematic becaue my state COVID cases tables
include the state names multiple times since it is a time series data. However it does not impeded too much on my analysis because I am only looking
at total COVID cases in 2021 and 2022 which means I can just subset the table to avoid this issue.

3.	How do you store your data on disk?
The database is automatically managed by SQLITE3 and stored on local disk.

4.	Letâ€™s say you find another data source that relates to all 3 of your data sources (i.e. a data source that relates to your existing data).  
How would you extend your model to include this new data source?  How would that change the interface?  
The fact that I chose SQL database as the model makes the addition of another data source really easy. The data source could just be
appended as another table and use state names as the key to relate to other tables.

5.	How would you add a new attribute to your data (for example: imagine you had a lat/long column in a database.  You might use that to access an API to get a city name.  How would you add city name to your data?)  
SQL tables lend themselves well to be processed as pandas dataframe. I can just export the table out of my SQL database into pandas and insert
new columns into the table and store the modified table back into the SQL database.
